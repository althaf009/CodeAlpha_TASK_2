                <h2>Introduction to Phishing</h2>
                <p>Phishing is a form of cyber attack that seeks to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. These attacks are often disguised as legitimate communications from trusted entities, such as banks or online services.</p>
                <p>Phishing attacks typically occur through email, social media, or fake websites, aiming to trick users into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.</p>

                <!-- Email Phishing -->
                <div class="phishing-type">
                    <h3>Email Phishing</h3>
                    <p>Email phishing is the most common form of phishing attack. Attackers send emails that appear to come from legitimate sources, such as banks or well-known companies. These emails often contain links to fake websites designed to steal personal information or install malware on your computer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> An email claiming to be from your bank asks you to click a link to verify your account information, which leads to a fake website designed to steal your login credentials.</p>

                <!-- Spear Phishing -->
                <div class="phishing-type">
                    <h3>Spear Phishing</h3>
                    <p>Spear phishing is a targeted attack aimed at a specific individual or organization. Unlike general phishing attacks, spear phishing emails are crafted using information gathered about the victim, making them more convincing and harder to detect.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> An email appearing to come from your company’s IT department requests you to click a link to update your login credentials, but it's actually a scam designed to steal your information.</p>

                <div class="phishing-type">
                    <h3>Vishing (Voice Phishing)</h3>
                    <p>Vishing involves phone calls from attackers posing as legitimate entities such as banks or government agencies. They attempt to trick you into providing sensitive information over the phone, often by creating a sense of urgency or using familiar language.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A caller claims to be from your bank’s fraud department, asking you to confirm your account details to prevent a security breach.</p>

                    <h3>Smishing (SMS Phishing)</h3>
                    <p>Smishing is a type of phishing attack carried out via SMS or text messages. Attackers send messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, often containing links to fraudulent websites or requests for personal information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You receive a text message claiming to be from your bank, asking you to click a link to verify your account details or respond with personal information.</p>

                    <h3>Clone Phishing</h3>
                    <p>Clone phishing involves creating a near-identical copy of a legitimate email that you previously received. The attacker replaces the legitimate links or attachments with malicious ones, hoping you’ll interact with the fake content.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You receive a copy of a legitimate email from a company you trust, but the links in the email lead to a phishing site designed to steal your information.</p>
